## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This is Minecraft Forge mod that is currently in early development. The idea is to add gods to the game that player will be able to gain rewards from as well as battle.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Follow the instructions below on how to setup a development environment on your own machine. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- **IDE**
- **Gradle** support in your IDE

**Recommended IDEs:**
- Eclipse
- IntelliJ IDEA
- VSCode

Forge only explicitly supports Eclipse but the other two IDEs should work fine without any issues.

### Setting Up Environment

1. Clone this repo
2. Open the project's root folder
2. Run Gradle. This depends on your IDE
    - **Eclipse**
        1. Run `gradlew genEclipseRuns` if you are on Windows or `./gradlew genEclipseRuns` if you are on Mac/Linux
        2. Open Eclipse, Import > Existing Gradle Project > Select Folder 
   or run `./gradlew eclipse` to generate the project.
    - **IntelliJ IDEA**
        1. Select your build.gradle file and have it import.
        2. Run `gradlew genIntellijRuns` if you are on Windows or `./gradlew genIntellijRuns` if you are on Mac/Linux
        3. Refresh the Gradle Project in IDEA if required.
    - **VSCode**
        1. Run `gradlew genVSCodeRuns` if you are on Windows or `./gradlew genVSCodeRuns` if you are on Mac/Linux

This should have generated even more folders and files that will be needed for development and building the project
